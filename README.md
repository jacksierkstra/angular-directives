# Angular directives
This is just a hobby project of mine to experiment with directives for AngularJS. Do you want to try it? Do the following steps:

`git clone git@github.com:jacksierkstra/angular-directives.git`

Then you need to install the required bower dependencies. Cd to the cloned repo by doing the following `cd angular-directives` and install the bower dependencies: `bower install`. No you need to have a simple http server. I am running http server, which is a npm module. Run `npm install -g http-server` and after that you can do `http-server`. The standard address that is opened is http://127.0.0.1:8080.
